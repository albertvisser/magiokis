Magiokis!?
==========

My first attempt at building a dynamic website, started around 2001 apparently and
more or less completed around 2006 I guess.

The project also contains some related webapps.

This is mostly here to showcase how I did it before having tried using a framework
like Django.

However I did make some recent adjustments needed to make this work (apparently
stuff got broken when changing computers and operating systems).

Usage
-----

Copy server configs. Point to the chosen (local) domains. Plural, because this is about multiple "web" locations.

Requirements
------------

- Python
